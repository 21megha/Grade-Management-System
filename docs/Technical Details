## 🔧 Technical Details

### 1. System Architecture
The Grade Management System is a **console-based Java application** designed using a **modular architecture**.  
Each functionality is separated into dedicated classes to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability.

The system follows a **procedural + object-oriented approach**, where:
- The main menu and user interaction are handled by the main class.
- Student data is encapsulated in a data model class.
- Calculations and report generation are handled using utility classes.

### 2. Data Structures Used

- **Arrays**
  - `String[] studentNames`  
    Stores names of students.
  - `double[][] studentMarks`  
    A 2D array to store marks of multiple students across multiple subjects.
    - Rows → Students
    - Columns → Subjects

- **ArrayList (optional enhancement)**
  - Used in `StudentGrade.java` to dynamically store marks for flexibility.

- **Primitive Data Types**
  - `int`, `double`, `String` for storing marks, averages, and grades.

### 3. Algorithms Implemented

#### a) Average Marks Calculation
- Sum of marks across all subjects.
- Average = Total Marks / Number of Subjects.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)** per student.

#### b) Grade Calculation Algorithm
Grades are assigned based on average marks:
- A+ : 90–100  
- A  : 80–89  
- B  : 70–79  
- C  : 60–69  
- D  : 50–59  
- F  : Below 50  

Implemented using **conditional (if-else) logic**.

#### c) Highest & Lowest Marks
- Iterates through subject marks to determine:
  - Highest score
  - Lowest score
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**.

#### d) Search Functionality
- Linear search is used to find a student by name.
- Suitable for small to medium datasets.
- Time Complexity: **O(n)**.

### 4. Validation Logic

- Ensures marks entered are within **0–100 range**.
- Uses loops and exception handling to prevent invalid
